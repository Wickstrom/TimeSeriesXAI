# Uncertainty and interpretablity in classification of clinical time series

Code used in the article "Uncertainty-Aware Deep Ensembles for Reliable and Explainable Predictions of Clinical Time Series".

## Experiments on synthetic data

Code for replicating experiments on synthetic data contained in the "NotebookSyntheticExperiment".

## Experiments on ecg data

Code for replicating experiments on the ECGO200 dataset contained in the "NotebookECG200Experiment". In the notebook you need to specify a path to the training and test data that is provided in this repository. The ECG200 data is obtained from The UCR Time Series Archive (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07758). See this website for more information: http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG200.
