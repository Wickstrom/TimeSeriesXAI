TODO: add text and code

## Experiments on ecg data

Code for replicating experiments contained in the "NotebookECG200Experiment". In the notebook you need to specify a path to the training and test data that is provided in this repository. The ECG200 data is obtained from The UCR Time Series Archive (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07758).
